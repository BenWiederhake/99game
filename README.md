# 99game

> A CLI version of a nameless game that I dubbed "99game".

The game is completely deterministic, so this program can also be used to
quickly check whether a sequence of moves is valid.

Hopefully this is implemented modular enough to also be used as a
kind of search library.

## Install

No installation required.

## Usage

Just use it!  No dependencies, but you need to run it in a console.

```sh
$ ./99game.py --help
FIXME
```

## TODOs

* Everything

## NOTDOs

Here are some things this project will not support:
* GUI.
* Advanced AI.
* Anything networking.

These are highly unlikely, but if you actually need them and can tell me
how to elegantly implement it, I might look into it:
* More efficient.
* Stupid AI.
* Nicer representation.
* Nicer terminal control. (Stay in "one window"?)
